### III. AI Prompts for Customer Segmentation
#### 1. Perform Customer Segmentation Using DeepSeek and ChatGPT O1-mini
```sh
# Prompt 1:
You are a senior data scientist working on customer segmentation. Analyze the below data and give me a direction to cluster our customer.

Dataset: {{
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/Spark-The-Definitive-Guide/refs/heads/master/data/retail-data/all/online-retail-dataset.csv
}}

# Prompt 2:
You did a good job. Now follow the suggested instruction to build clustering model using Kmeans method. After building a model, you need to analyze the results, extract insights and assess the business impact.

# Advanced prompt (Generated using chat GPT 4o)
You are a senior data scientist working on customer segmentation. 

Follow the below instructions to do step by step analysis for the provided dataset. Show your thought in detail during each step and provide the full code in the end.

1. Provide basic information of dataset and summarize the dataset by following:
   - Identify key metrics, including:
     - Data period
     - Number of records
     - Number of unique products
     - Number of unique customers
     - Total purchase volume
     - Average and total unit price
     - Bar plot for top 10 most saled items

2. Preprocess the data:
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove duplicates

3. Perform feature engineering:
   - Extract relevant features for segmentation
   - Normalize and scale data if needed

4. Build the AI model
   - Implement a clustering model for customer segmentation.
   - Limit the clusters below 5

5. Analyze the results and extract insights:
   - Evaluate the segmentation output.
   - Explain the characteristics of each cluster.

6. Assess the business impact:
   - Estimate the potential revenue impact using segmentation result.
   - Ensure the caculated values are meaningful.

Additional requirements:
   - Ensure the code is fully executable without error to run in Google Colab.
   - Use `display()` instead of `print()` for DataFrames.
   - Add `print("=== <what will be shown> ===")` statements to clarify outputs.
   - Separate printed or plotted results with clear delimiters.
   - Filter unnecessary system or library warnings for a cleaner output.

}}
```
### 2. Additional Enhancements
```sh
# Prompt 3:
You did a good job. Now, Based on the clustering results, do the following tasks.

1. Calculate below statistic for each cluster
- Average and Sum of Quantity, Unit Price, Total Price
- Count of invoices
- Count of unique products
- Mean Invoice Count Per Product
- Number products count per invoice
- Unit price mean per invoice
- Total price mean per invoice
- Total price sum per invoice
- Quantity Sum per invoice
- Unit price mean per stock
- Quantity sum per stock
- Tototal price mean per stock
- Total price sum per stock

2. Visualize ALL calculated metrics using a radar plot
- Draw 2 plot one show the real values without scaled, and another show the values after converted into compareable scale
- Ensure that 1 plot displaying all clusters with clear view of each cluster

3. Provide an insight from the result
- Provide an meaningful insight for this result and what strategies we should take to maximize the potential revenue

Additional requirements:
- Ensure the code is fully executable in Google Colab.
- Ensure to calculate total price = Quantity x 'UnitPrice' before calculatation.
- Ensure the visualization is clear, well-labeled, and comparable in scale across clusters.
- Provide insights from the results and propose clear business strategies based on the analyzed data.
```
